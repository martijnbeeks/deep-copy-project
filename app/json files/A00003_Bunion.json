Here's what's REALLY happening inside your foot right now... You're Experiencing Progressive Toe Deviation (PTD). We call this process Progressive Toe Deviation (PTD), and it's the root cause of the crippling pain, swelling, unsightly appearance, and trouble walking that people with bunions experience. You see, you have muscles on both sides of your big toe. One side has become way too tight and is constantly pulling your toe INWARD toward your other toes. Meanwhile, the muscles that should be pulling it back have become weak and useless. This creates a devastating tug-of-war inside your foot where the tight muscles ALWAYS win, dragging your toe further and further out of position every single day."

Wider shoes and orthotics - Provide comfort but do nothing to reverse the muscle imbalance causing your bunion. Foot exercises - Help somewhat, but can't provide the precise, consistent pressure needed to realign your displaced joint. Surgery - Cuts and repositions bone but doesn't fix the muscle problem, which is why nearly 50% of bunions return even after surgery. This is why you feel hopeless - nothing addresses bunions where they actually start: your foot muscles. But what if I told you there's finally a way to reverse bunions at their source? A breakthrough that retrains those imbalanced muscles without surgery, without pain, and from the comfort of your own home..."

You see, while other treatments focus on managing symptoms, Advanced Alignment Therapy actually REVERSES the muscle imbalance that created your bunion in the first place. This is the ONLY method that works WITH your body's natural biomechanics to gradually pull your toe back into its proper position - like having braces for your teeth, but for your toes. Introducing Treatmedy Bunion Fix. The Treatmedy Bunion Fix is the first device that delivers Advanced Alignment Therapy with a breakthrough Patented Hinge Joint Mechanism. Advanced Alignment Therapy supports the realignment of the big toe and gradually alleviates inflammation and pain. Patented Hinge Joint Mechanism allows you to adjust the stretch and therapy intensity to your needs since every foot and bunion is different and requires a unique approach. It helps release muscular tension by simply pulling your bunion back to its natural position, resulting in pain-free natural realignment that actually LASTS. The best part? You can experience relief in as little as 30 minutes a day! It's perfect for stationary use, like lounging on the couch, watching TV, reading, or sleeping."

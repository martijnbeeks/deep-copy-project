# Campaign Strategy Brief: Guide for Non-Technical Stakeholders

This guide explains the structure of the **Offer Brief**, which is a questionnaire used to gather all the "ingredients" needed for the AI to generate marketing copy, campaign concepts, and funnel assets.

---

### **Section 1: The Core Offer & Idea**
This section defines the "soul" of the campaign.

*   **Potential Product Names:** A list of brainstormed names for the product or offer.
*   **The Big Idea:** The single, most important central concept that makes the entire campaign unique and exciting.
*   **Metaphors & Analogies:** Simple images or comparisons used to make the "Big Idea" easy for a customer to visualize (e.g., *"This supplement works like a thermostat for your metabolism"*).
*   **The "Problem" Mechanism (UMP):** A counterintuitive explanation of why the customer’s problem has been so hard to solve until now.
*   **The "Solution" Mechanism (UMS):** A clear explanation of the unique "secret sauce" inside this product that finally solves the problem.
*   **The "Guru" or Spokesperson:** The authority figure or personality (real or a character type) who is presenting the offer.
*   **The Discovery Story:** The narrative of how the solution was found—the "aha!" moment, the failed attempts, and the final breakthrough.

---

### **Section 2: The Product Details**
The specific facts about what is being sold.

*   **Product Name:** The final or working name of the product.
*   **Simple Description:** What it is, who it’s for, and the main results it delivers.
*   **The Specifics:** Details like the format (e.g., video course, physical book), what’s included, bonuses, guarantees, and the price.

### **Section 3: Understanding the Customer**
This section helps define who is being targeted and what they already know.

*   **Readiness for Change (Consciousness):** Is the customer actively looking for a change (High) or just starting to realize they have a problem (Low)?
*   **Current Awareness Level:** Where is the customer in their journey?
    *   *Unaware:* They don't even know they have a problem yet.
    *   *Problem Aware:* They know they have a problem but don't know how to fix it.
    *   *Solution Aware:* They know there are ways to fix it but haven't found a specific product.
    *   *Product Aware:* They know about your product but aren't convinced yet.
    *   *Most Aware:* They know your product and just need a final reason to buy.
*   **Market Sophistication:** How "tired" or skeptical is the market? (e.g., Is this a brand new type of product, or have they heard a million similar promises before?)

---

### **Section 4: Messaging & Objections**
The actual words and logic used to convince the customer.

*   **Headline Ideas:** Catchy titles and sub-titles for ads or websites that grab attention.
*   **The Belief Chain:** A step-by-step list of small things the customer must believe before they feel comfortable buying (e.g., *"First they must believe the old way is broken, then they must believe this new mechanism works..."*).
*   **Common Objections:** A list of every reason someone might say "no" (price, time, credibility, fit, complexity, risk, etc.).

---

### **Section 5: Logistics & Inspiration**
The practical layout and references.

*   **Funnel Architecture:** The "map" of the customer's journey (e.g., *"Ad → Lead Magnet → Nurture → VSL → Checkout → Upsell"*).
*   **Desired Web Addresses:** A list of potential domain names or URLs for the website.
*   **Inspiration & Examples (Swipes):** Links or notes about other successful campaigns or designs that we should look at for inspiration.

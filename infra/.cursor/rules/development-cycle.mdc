Please use the following workflow:
Enforces the 'No Vibes Allowed' workflow (Research > Plan > Code) for all development tasks.
•⁠  ⁠*Phase 1: Research (Investigation)*
  - Use ⁠ grep ⁠, ⁠ ls ⁠, and ⁠ read_file ⁠ to map the codebase before proposing any changes.
  - *DO NOT* rely on memory or "vibes" of how the code works; verify exact line ranges and logic.
  - Identify all side effects and dependencies that could be impacted.

•⁠  ⁠*Phase 2: Plan (User Story Creation)*
  - Every task must begin with a User Story (US) draft in ⁠ user_stories/ ⁠.
  - You must follow the rules in [how_cursor_should_write_user_stories.md](.cursor/rules/how-to-write-user-stories.mdc).
  - The plan is only ⁠ 🟢 READY ⁠ once the *Desired Implementation* is technically validated by Phase 1 findings.

•⁠  ⁠*Phase 3: Code (Strict Execution)*
  - Act as a pure execution agent for the ⁠ 🟢 READY ⁠ User Story.
  - *DO NOT* perform "drive-by refactoring" or expand the scope silently.
  - If you encounter a technical blocker, stop and revert to Phase 1 (Research) to update the Plan.

•⁠  ⁠*Phase 4: Completion & Context Hygiene*
  - Once tasks are finished, move the US to ⁠ completed_user_stories/ ⁠ and set status to ⁠ ✅ COMPLETED ⁠.
  - Immediately generate the ⁠ IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md ⁠ as per project requirements.
  - Summarize what was *not* changed to maintain clear mental alignment with the user.

•⁠  ⁠*Workflow Guardrails:*
  ```typescript
  ✅ DO: Investigate and Plan
  1. grep "export const useAuth" 
  2. Create US_10_AUTH_FIX.md
  3. Execute numbered tasks in US_10
  
  ❌ DON'T: "Vibe" or Guess
  "I think the auth logic is in utils.ts, I'll just change it now..."
  ```

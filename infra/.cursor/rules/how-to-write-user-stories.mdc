# User Story Rules (Compressed)

## Purpose

User Stories (US) are *execution instructions, not discussion. They must tell an execution agent **what to change, where, and when it is done*.

---

## Mandatory Structure (in this order)

### Title

⁠ text
# Story <ID> — <concise action>
 ⁠

One sentence. No fluff.

### Status

⁠ text
**Status:** 🟡 DRAFT | 🟢 READY | 🟠 CODE WRITTEN (NEEDS TESTING) | ✅ COMPLETED
 ⁠

### Role

⁠ text
**Role:** <single accountable role>
 ⁠

### Context

Only what is needed to understand *what is broken or risky today*.

### Goal

One paragraph. Testable outcome. No implementation details.

### Dependency

Explicit list or ⁠ None ⁠.

### Current Implementation (must change)

•⁠  ⁠Concrete file paths
•⁠  ⁠Headings (⁠ ### 1) ⁠, ⁠ ### 2) ⁠ …)
•⁠  ⁠Code snippets + line ranges
•⁠  ⁠Explicit inconsistencies / bugs

### Desired Implementation (target state)

•⁠  ⁠Structural outcome
•⁠  ⁠Ownership / centralization
•⁠  ⁠Naming conventions

### Execution Phases (required)

User Stories must only cover execution (investigation is done before the US is written) and must explicitly separate phases so “code written” and “proof it works” are never skipped.

•⁠  ⁠*Implementation (code written)*: the exact code changes to make (files + what to change).
•⁠  ⁠*Testing / Verification*: how to confirm it works (commands to run and/or UI steps; expected result).

### Task

Numbered, checkable steps. No vague verbs. Steps must be written under the phases above (or clearly reference them).

### Constraints

Explicit limits (or say ⁠ None ⁠).

### Acceptance Criteria

Binary, verifiable, non-subjective.

### Files to Edit (Expected)

Concrete paths only.

## Completion Rules (Hard)

When a US is finished:

1.⁠ ⁠*Preserve original US text*
1.⁠ ⁠If code is written but testing/verification is not yet done, set:

⁠ text
**Status:** 🟠 CODE WRITTEN (NEEDS TESTING)
 ⁠

1.⁠ ⁠Only after Testing / Verification passes, change status to:

⁠ text
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
 ⁠

1.⁠ ⁠Move file to:

⁠ text
user_stories/completed/
 ⁠

---

## Implementation Summary (Required)

For every completed US, add:

⁠ text
user_stories/completed/
  ├── US_<ID>.md
  └── US_<ID>_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
 ⁠

Summary must include:

•⁠  ⁠What changed (per file)
•⁠  ⁠What did NOT change (and why)
•⁠  ⁠Deviations from US
•⁠  ⁠New risks / tech debt

---

## Non‑Negotiables

•⁠  ⁠Never delete or rewrite a US
•⁠  ⁠No silent scope expansion
•⁠  ⁠New scope = new US
•⁠  ⁠If unclear → stop and ask

Violation = invalid execution.

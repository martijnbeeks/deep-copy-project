Potential Product Name Ideas: 

Level of consciousness: Low/High

Level of Awareness:

Stage of Sophistication:
    Level 1
    Birth of market

    Buyers are new to the category; you can simply state your core claim.

    Level 2
    Outshine the competition

    The market has seen basic claims. You must make your promise bigger or more dramatic than others.

    Level 3
    Introduce a mechanism

    Skeptical buyers ask “How can that be true?” So you present an underlying mechanism or logical reason that makes your claim believable.

    Level 4
    Upgrade or improve the mechanism

    Competitors have copied your first “secret sauce,” so you need a better mechanism or a “Version 2.0” of your original solution.

    Level 5
    Maximum skepticism

    Buyers no longer accept any simple mechanisms. You must employ entirely new, advanced strategies (e.g., revolutionary frameworks, social proof systems, immersive experiences) to break through their cynicism.

**Step 1 Icon: Droplet/Shower**  
**Step 1 Headline:** Wash & Dry  
**Step 1 Copy:** Cleanse your beard and the skin beneath with warm water. Pat dry. (Best results: apply when pores are open after a hot shower.)

**Step 2 Icon: Hand with Cream**  
**Step 2 Headline:** Apply & Massage (2–3 Minutes)  
**Step 2 Copy:** Dispense a pea-sized amount for short beards, almond-sized for medium, marble-sized for full beards. Massage directly into the skin beneath your beard using circular motions. The lightweight cream absorbs quickly—no rinsing needed.

**Step 3 Icon: Beard/Face**

## ASSET 5: Sensory & Usage Microcopy Block (for product detail area)

**Section Headline:** What to Expect

**Texture:** Smooth, lightweight cream. Spreads easily through coarse beard hair without dragging or clumping.

**Finish:** Matte, non-greasy. Absorbs fully in 3–5 minutes without visible residue or shine. Won't leave white flakes or film on gray hair.

**Scent:** Mild herbal note with a cooling menthol undertone. Dissipates within 30 seconds of application—won't interfere with cologne or aftershave.

**Amount Guidance:**  
• Short beard (under 2"): Pea-sized amount  
• Medium beard (2–4"): Almond-sized amount  
• Full beard (4"+): Marble-sized amount  

*Pro tip: Apply to beard skin, not the hair itself. The formula is designed to penetrate and treat the skin where flaking and inflammation begin.*

**When to Use:**  
Morning (after shower) and evening (before bed) for active treatment. Once flakes are under control, most men maintain results with 1–2 applications daily.

**Integration with Other Products:**  
Safe to use with beard oils, balms, and styling products. Apply NewAura first, wait 2–3 minutes for absorption, then layer your other grooming products as usual.

## ASSET 8: FAQ Section (Objection-Handling Copy)

**Q: Is this safe for sensitive, aging skin?**  
A: Yes. NewAura is formulated without steroids, parabens, or harsh synthetic chemicals. It's commonly used by men 45+ with sensitive or mature facial skin. If you have known allergies to botanical ingredients, we recommend a patch test on your inner forearm before applying to your face or beard.

---

**Q: Will this stain my gray beard or leave white residue?**  
A: No. The cream is formulated without dyes, brighteners, or chalk-like fillers. It absorbs fully without visible residue and will not tint, yellow, or discolor gray or white beard hair.

---

**Q: How does this work with my beard oil and other grooming products?**  
A: Apply NewAura first and wait 2–3 minutes for full absorption. Then apply your beard oil, balm, or cologne as usual. The cream creates a therapeutic base layer; your styling and scent products layer over it without reducing effectiveness.

---

**Q: How quickly will I see results?**  
A: Most users notice itch relief within hours to a few days. Visible flake reduction typically appears within 3–7 days, as your skin's natural turnover cycle begins to normalize. Consistency is key—apply 2–3 times daily during the first two weeks for best results.

---

**Q: Do I have to change my whole grooming routine?**  
A: No. NewAura fits into your existing shower and grooming routine. Just add one step: after washing and drying your beard, massage the cream into the skin beneath. It takes about 3 minutes. No special schedules, no complicated protocols.

---

**Q: What if I've tried "natural" or "herbal" products before and they didn't work?**  
A: We hear this a lot. Many herbal beard oils and balms moisturize the hair but don't treat the skin condition driving the flakes and itch. NewAura is formulated specifically to penetrate through coarse beard hair and deliver active botanicals to the skin, where seborrheic dermatitis originates. It's not a moisturizer or fragrance—it's a treatment cream.

---

**Q: Is your 60-day money-back guarantee real?**  
A: Absolutely. If NewAura doesn't deliver visible relief within 60 days, email us and we'll issue a full refund—even if the jars are empty. No forms to fill out. No hassle. Your satisfaction is the only measure of our success.

---

**Q: How does this compare to ketoconazole (Nizoral)?**  
A: Ketoconazole is a proven antifungal and works well for many men, but it requires you to remember a 2–3x weekly schedule and leave it on for 5–10 minutes. It's also a shampoo, which means you're treating your beard hair more than the skin beneath. NewAura is a leave-on cream you can apply daily, directly to the skin under your beard, without worrying about timing or rinsing. Many of our customers switched to NewAura after Nizoral provided only temporary relief or became inconvenient to maintain.

---

**Q: Will the flakes come back if I stop using it?**  
A: Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic condition, so ongoing maintenance is usually needed to keep flakes and itch at bay. Most NewAura users transition from active treatment (2–3x daily) to maintenance (1–2x daily) after the first two weeks and maintain clear skin long-term. Think of it like brushing your teeth—consistent, simple care prevents recurrence.

---

**Q: Can I use this if I have psoriasis or eczema, too?**  
A: Many customers use NewAura for psoriasis, eczema, and seborrheic dermatitis. The formula is gentle and designed for inflamed, scaling skin. However, if you're under a dermatologist's care or using prescription treatments, check with your doctor before adding any new topical product.

## ASSET 9: Hero Testimonial (long-form, for placement near CTA or in dedicated section)

**Testimonial Headline:** "I've Had My Beard for 15 Years. This Is What Finally Worked."

**Testimonial Body:**

"I'm 52, and I've worn a beard since my late 30s. About two years ago, I started noticing flakes—first just a little, then every day, all over my collar and shirt. I'm a manager, and I'm in client meetings constantly. The embarrassment was brutal.

I tried everything: Head & Shoulders, Nizoral twice a week, expensive beard oils from boutique brands, even prescription hydrocortisone for a week (until I read about the skin-thinning risks and stopped). Nizoral worked for about ten days, then the flakes came roaring back. The oils felt good but did nothing for the actual problem.

I found NewAura through a Reddit thread where older guys were talking about non-steroid options. I'll be honest—I was skeptical. 'Herbal' usually means 'smells nice but doesn't work.' But the 60-day guarantee convinced me to try it.

Within three days, the itching stopped. I mean *stopped*—I could finally get through meetings without wanting to claw at my face. By day seven, I looked in the mirror under bright light and the flakes were just… gone. Not reduced. Gone.

It's not greasy. It doesn't smell like a health food store. I apply it after my morning shower, wait a couple minutes, then use my usual beard oil. Takes three minutes, max. I've been using it for four months now, and I haven't had a single flake incident.

I can wear black shirts again. I can focus in meetings. My wife says I look ten years younger because I'm not constantly scratching and stressing.

If you've tried everything and you're frustrated, just try this. Sixty days is enough time to know. For me, it was a week."

**—Marcus L., 52, Portland, OR**  
*Manager, Tech Industry / Gray Beard, 4+ inches*

**Design note:** Pair this testimonial with a high-quality photo of Marcus (real customer, permission secured) showing his beard—ideally a professional headshot or candid in a work setting. If video is possible, even better (30–60 second version of this story).

## ASSET 10: Email Sequence—The 14-Day Flake-Free Challenge (Full Copy, 7 Emails)

### **Email 1: Welcome & Setup (Send Day 1, immediately upon purchase)**

**Subject Line:** Your NewAura Just Shipped—Here's How to Get the Best Results  
**Preview Text:** Read this before your first application

---

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Welcome to the NewAura family—and congratulations on taking action to beat beard dandruff for good.

Your order just shipped, and you should see it within [X] business days. While you're waiting, I want to make sure you get the absolute best results from your first jar.

**Here's what to expect over the next 14 days:**

• **Days 1–3:** Many users notice itch relief within hours to a couple of days. Your skin is beginning to calm.

• **Days 3–7:** Visible flake reduction typically starts here. You'll notice fewer flakes on your collar and less redness under your beard.

• **Days 7–14:** Flaking and inflammation continue to decrease. By day 14, most users are ready to transition from active treatment (2–3x daily) to maintenance mode (1–2x daily).

**Pro Tip for Your First Application:**

Apply NewAura right after a hot shower when your pores are open and your beard is damp (but not soaking wet). Use a pea-sized amount for short beards, almond-sized for medium, and marble-sized for full beards.

Massage directly into the *skin beneath your beard* using circular motions for 2–3 minutes. Don't just coat the hair—get to the skin where the problem starts.

The cream absorbs in 3–5 minutes. Once it's fully absorbed, you can layer your beard oil or balm over it if you like.

**Quick Question:**

Hit reply and let me know your beard type (short / medium / full) and how long you've been dealing with flakes. I'll send you personalized tips based on your situation.

Looking forward to hearing about your progress.

### **Email 2: Day 3 Check-In (Send Day 3)**

**Subject Line:** Day 3 of 14—Quick Win?  
**Preview Text:** Most customers notice immediate itch relief

---

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

You're three days into your 14-Day Flake-Free Challenge. How's it going so far?

**Here's what's normal at this stage:**

Many users notice itch relief almost immediately—within hours or by day 2. If you're one of them, that's your skin telling you the formula is working.

Visible flake reduction usually takes a bit longer (5–7 days), because your skin cells need time to turn over and shed the damaged layers. So if you're not seeing fewer flakes *yet*, don't worry—you're right on track.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**

If you haven't noticed *any* change yet (not even in itch), try these tweaks:

• **Increase frequency:** Bump up to 3x daily if you're only doing 2x.  
• **Use slightly more product:** You might need a bit more cream if you have a thick, coarse beard.  
• **Apply right after a hot shower:** Open pores = better absorption.

**Real User at Day 3:**

*"I wasn't sure if it was working until I realized I hadn't scratched my beard once today. That's huge for me."*  
—Tom, 58, Chicago

Hang in there—results are coming. I'll check in with you again at the one-week mark.

### **Email 3: Day 7 Milestone (Send Day 7)**

**Subject Line:** Day 7 Results—Time to Check Your Beard  
**Preview Text:** Celebrate the one-week mark

---

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

You've hit the one-week milestone—congrats.

This is typically when users start seeing visible flake reduction. Here's what to look for:

✓ Fewer flakes on your collar, shoulders, or shirt  
✓ Less redness or irritation when you look at your beard skin in the mirror  
✓ Reduced itching or tightness  
✓ Smoother skin texture under your beard

**Take a moment and check:**

Go to a well-lit mirror (natural light is best) and take a close look at the skin beneath your beard. Compare it to how it looked a week ago.

Most users see a noticeable difference by now. If you're one of them—*celebrate it*. You've earned it.

**If you're not quite there yet:**

Some guys need 10–14 days, especially if they have very coarse beards or severe flaking. Keep going. Try applying immediately after your shower when your skin is most receptive, and make sure you're massaging the cream into the *skin*, not just the hair.

**Share Your Win:**

If you're seeing results, I'd love to hear about it. Hit reply and tell me what you've noticed. (Bonus: If you're willing to share a quick photo or short video testimonial, we feature customer wins on our site—and we'll send you a thank-you discount code for your next order.)

One week down, one week to go. You've got this.

**Subject Line:** Day 10—Level Up Your Routine  
**Preview Text:** The optional step 500+ customers are using

---

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

You're deep into week two, and your beard skin is improving. Here's an advanced tip that many of our long-term customers swear by:

**Layer NewAura with your beard oil or balm.**

Here's how it works:

1. Apply NewAura first (as usual) and massage it into the skin beneath your beard.  
2. Wait 2–3 minutes for full absorption.  
3. Apply a lightweight, non-comedogenic beard oil or balm over the top.

**Why this works:**

NewAura treats the *skin* (calms inflammation, reduces yeast, stops flaking). Beard oil hydrates and softens the *hair*. Together, they give you a flake-free, healthy-looking, well-groomed beard.

**Which beard oils work best?**

Stick with lightweight, non-comedogenic oils like jojoba, argan, or grapeseed. Avoid heavy mineral oils or petroleum-based products, which can clog pores or interfere with absorption.

**Real User Tip:**

*"I've been using NewAura in the morning and my regular beard oil at night. My beard has never looked or felt better. The flakes are gone, and my beard is actually soft now—my wife noticed."*  
—Dan, 54, Austin

Hit reply if you have a favorite beard oil you'd like to pair with NewAura—we're building a "Works Great With NewAura" guide and I'd love to include your recommendation.

Keep it up. You're almost there.

### **Email 5: Day 12 Maintenance Planning (Send Day 12)**

**Subject Line:** Day 12 of 14—Plan Your Next Chapter  
**Preview Text:** Most customers transition to maintenance by day 14

---

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

You're two days away from completing your 14-Day Flake-Free Challenge. Nice work.

Now's the time to think about what comes next.

**Here's the reality:**

Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic condition. That means your skin will always have a tendency to flare up if you stop treating it. The good news? Once you've got it under control, *maintenance is easy*.

**Active Treatment vs. Maintenance:**

• **Active treatment (Days 1–14):** 2–3 applications per day to get flakes and itch under control.  
• **Maintenance (Day 15+):** Most customers maintain clear skin with just 1–2 applications per day.

**Experiment and find your minimum effective dose.**

Some guys need 2x daily long-term. Others can get away with 1x daily or even every-other-day once their skin stabilizes. Your beard, your call.

**Never Run Out:**

If you want to stay stocked without thinking about it, we offer a quarterly auto-ship option (3 jars every 90 days) at a 15% discount. Cancel anytime, no strings attached.

[Link: Set Up Quarterly Auto-Ship]

**Real User on Maintenance:**

**Preview Text:** See the full 14-day transformation

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

You did it. Fourteen days. You've completed the Flake-Free Challenge.

**Now's the time to reflect:**

Go to a mirror, take a close look at your beard and the skin beneath, and ask yourself:

• How does the itching compare to two weeks ago?  
• Are the flakes gone—or at least dramatically reduced?  
• Does your beard look and feel healthier?  
• Do you feel more confident when you're in meetings, at work, or out in public?

Most users who stick with the protocol see dramatic improvement by this point. If that's you—*own it*. This is what consistency looks like.

**If you're not 100% satisfied yet:**

Some guys need a few more days, especially if their condition was severe or their beards are very coarse. Keep going for another week at 2–3x daily and reassess.

And remember: **You're covered by our 60-day money-back guarantee.** If NewAura isn't delivering the results you hoped for, just reply to this email or contact our support team for a full refund. No questions, no hassle.

**Share Your Results (and Get Featured):**

If NewAura worked for you, we'd love to share your story with other men who are still struggling.

Hit reply with:

• A short summary of your experience (2–4 sentences)  
• A photo of you and your beard (optional but awesome)  
• Your first name, age, and city

We feature customer wins on our website and in our emails. Plus, we'll send you a 15% off code for your next order as a thank-you.

**What Happens Next?**

You've proven that you can get control over beard dandruff. Now it's about *sustaining* it.

Most customers transition to 1–2 applications per day and maintain clear skin indefinitely. Stay consistent, keep a jar on hand, and you'll never go back to the days of flakes on your collar.

Congrats on finishing strong.

### **Email 7: Day 21 Long-Term Strategy & Loyalty Offer (Send Day 21)**

**Subject Line:** Week 3: The Maintenance Question  
**Preview Text:** Sustaining your results is easier than you think

---

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

It's been three weeks since you started using NewAura. By now, you know whether this product works for you—and if you're still here, I'm guessing the answer is yes.

**Here's the reality of maintenance:**

Keeping your beard clear and confident isn't exciting. It's not a dramatic transformation story anymore. It's just… *taking care of yourself*.

Like brushing your teeth. Like wearing deodorant. Like trimming your beard every few weeks.

It's boring. But it works.

**The Maintenance Mindset:**

Most of our long-term customers apply NewAura once or twice a day—usually in the morning after a shower—and that's it. They don't think about it. They don't stress about it. They just do it, and their beards stay clear.

**Here's the math:**

If you're using NewAura once a day (maintenance dose), one jar lasts about 45–60 days. That's roughly $0.65–$0.90 per day. Less than a cup of coffee.

**For customers who want to stay stocked without the hassle:**

We offer a **Quarterly Auto-Ship** option:

• 3 jars shipped every 90 days  
• 15% off your entire order  
• Free shipping  
• Cancel anytime (no contracts, no lock-in)

After three months of consistent use, loyal customers also unlock an **additional 10% loyalty discount** on future orders.

[Link: Set Up Quarterly Auto-Ship + Save 15%]

**Real User on Long-Term Maintenance:**

*"I set up the auto-ship six months ago and honestly forgot about it. My beard stays clear, a new jar shows up every few months, and I never have to think about reordering. It's one less thing to manage."*  
—Greg, 57, Nashville

**Or…**

If auto-ship isn't your thing, no worries. Just reorder manually when you're running low. We're here either way.

**One Last Thing:**

If you've had a great experience with NewAura and you know another guy who's dealing with beard dandruff, **refer a friend**. When they use your referral link and make their first purchase, you both get 15% off your next order.

Thanks for sticking with us. You've earned the confidence and clarity that comes with a flake-free beard.

Keep it up.
